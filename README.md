* This repo includes the coding exercises of Year 1 Semester 2 of a University Malaya Student in 2021.
The programming language used is Java while the content focus on the data structure.
The exercises require the students to create the data structure using raw code.
For example, create ListNode and MyLinkedList classes to build a Linked List.
This is very helpful in helping students to understand the concepts.

* This repo also included the data stucture lab exercises from previous session and past year questions.
