My name is Lee Hui Xin with matrix number, U2005353/1.
I am majoring in Information System.
This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject.
At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject.
This is because I like learning programming.

I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad.
So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term.
In order to do well in the subject, I will be more hardworking. Wish me luck!!!


How is the performance? Are you happy with your performance?
What has learning DS taught you
Is there any change to your target grade
What you did well during the course
What could have been done better during the course

It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! 
I think I did well in this course and I'm satisfied with the result.
Learning DS helps me understand how to apply different types of data structure.
I did well in finishing my group project but I can have done my problem solving test better
